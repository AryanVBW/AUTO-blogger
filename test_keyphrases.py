    <p>Manchester United are reportedly interested in signing a top Premier League defender 
    during the January transfer window. The Red Devils are looking to strengthen their 
    defensive options as they push for a top-four finish this season.</p>
    
    <p>Sources close to the club suggest that Erik ten Hag is keen on adding defensive
