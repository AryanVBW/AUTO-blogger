⚠️ **These are temporary fix scripts that may be outdated or superseded by newer implementations.**

These scripts were created during the development process to address specific issues. Many of the fixes contained in these scripts have likely been integrated into the main codebase. 

**Before using any script in this directory:**
1. Check if the issue still exists in the current version
2. Review the script content to understand what it does
3. Test in a development environment first
4. Consider if the fix has been integrated into the main application

## Cleanup

This directory can be safely removed once all fixes have been verified as integrated into the main codebase.
